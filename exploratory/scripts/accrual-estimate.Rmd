## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r create df}
# Update on accrual progress
today.date = as.Date("2020-06-20")
today.accrual = 53

# Create a vector of months from this update to the end of the funding period
trial.dates <- seq.Date(from = today.date, 
         to = as.Date("2022-12-31"),
         by = "month")

# Set the accrual rate (direct communication from David Carbone)
acc.rate <- 5

# Propagate the accrual from today throughout the rest of the study window
lengthvec <- 1:length(trial.dates)
on.insigna <- today.accrual + ((lengthvec - 1) * 5)

# Define a consent rate
consent.rate <- 0.9

df <- data.frame(
  Date = trial.dates,
  insigna = on.insigna,
  modbio = ceiling(
    on.insigna * consent.rate
  )
)

```

```{r}
df %>%
  gather(key = "Trial", value = "Accrued", -Date) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Accrued)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Trial)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggsave("../figures/accrual-timing.png", height = 3, width = 4)
```
